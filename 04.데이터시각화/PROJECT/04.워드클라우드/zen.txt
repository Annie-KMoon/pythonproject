Money can't buy 6th sense

Bad bitch 'kay so make me better
Fire aura quiets chatter
Shoo shoo shoo I make 'em scatter
They can't move my matter

Nobody gon
Move my soul
Gon move my aura
My matter
Nobody gon
Move my light
Gon touch my glow
My matter
Nobody gon
All this power
Make them scatter
No nobody
Gon touch my soul
Gon match my glow like

I dare you
Ah ah
Shake me
Ah ah
Hey

Thick skin layered like
Chains on chains on chains
Wear the pressure on my neck and rings

Rain
Midnight bloom
In the dark I grew

Freeze
Gleam
One hunnid
One hunnid
Ten
One hunnid
Money cannot buy no real friends

Baddest they can't make me badder
Fire aura quiets chatter
Shoo shoo shoo I make 'em scatter
They can't move my matter

Nobody gon
Move my soul
Gon move my aura
My matter
Nobody gon
Move my light
Gon touch my glow
My matter
Nobody gon
All this power
Make them scattered
No nobody
Gon touch my soul
Gon match my glow like

I dare you
Ah ah
Shake me
Ah ah
Hey
Ah ah
Ah ah

Can't be two of one
